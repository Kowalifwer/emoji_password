# Improving passwords using Emoji
Route:

Programming

Implementation:

We will create a GUI with two screens: a text entry field for a password, and a text entry field with several emoji buttons for another password. The GUI will allow users to create and enter passwords that are a combination of regular text input and two emoji. The positions of the emoji buttons would be randomised each time the interface is used. The second screen will display an indicator telling the user how strong the emoji-password is compared to their conventional password.

Evaluation:

We invite participants to enter a conventional password and a shorter emoji-password of equivalent strength. We then inform them that they will be sent an evaluation form to assess our interface. The evaluation form will be sent out a week later. The main purpose of the form is to get participants to submit their best attempts at remembering the passwords they created. We will calculate the Levenshtein distances of the original passwords with their submitted attempts.
